Flarum is a widely used simple and \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/flarum/flarum\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003eopen-source \u003c/a\u003eforum platform. At the time of this post, we estimate that there are about 1200 active Flarum websites.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eExploiting this vulnerability is very simple as the attacker just needs to create a post that included the payload on the target forum and wait for forum users to access the post. The attacker can then obtain cookies from the victims and take over their accounts on the forum.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eCyStack reported this issue to the Flarum team via \u003ca href=\"https://huntr.dev/bounties/disclose/?target=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fflarum%2Fcore\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003etheir bug bounty program\u003c/a\u003e and got confirmation from the team. A patch and announcement were released quickly after that at https://discuss.flarum.org/d/31999-critical-security-update-to-flarum-core-v162\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"details\"\u003eDetails\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe \u003cstrong\u003etitle \u003c/strong\u003eis a required field when a user creates a discussion in the forum. The problem here is that developers did not sanitize this variable before rendering to the HTML, which resulted in the attacker being able to generate malicious payloads and attach them to the title field when creating the post. Once the victim opens this post, a payload will be executed that can steal user cookies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to the Flarum team\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cblockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eFlarum\u0026#8217;s page title system allowed for discussion title inputs to be converted into HTML DOM nodes when rendered (visiting a discussion page). This change was made in v1.5.0 and was not noticed.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis allowed for any user to type malicious HTML markup within discussion title user input, either through a new discussion o renaming an existing one, and have this execute on client browsers. Entering faux-malicious HTML markup, such as\u0026nbsp;\u003ccode\u003e\u0026lt;img src=x onerror=alert(document.domain)\u0026gt;\u003c/code\u003e\u0026nbsp;resulted in an alert box appearing on the forum. This attack could also be modified to perform AJAX requests on behalf of a user, possibly deleting discussions, modifying their settings or profile, or even modifying settings on the Admin panel if the attack was targeted towards a privileged user.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ccite\u003ehttps://discuss.flarum.org/d/31999-critical-security-update-to-flarum-core-v162\u003c/cite\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"\u003ePoC\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"950\" height=\"327\" src=\"https://s.cystack.net/resource/home/content/19052738/image.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-15494\" srcset=\"https://s.cystack.net/resource/home/content/19052738/image-300x103.png 300w, https://s.cystack.net/resource/home/content/19052738/image-768x264.png 768w, https://s.cystack.net/resource/home/content/19052738/image.png 950w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 950px) 100vw, 950px\" /\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eCreate a Discussion with the payload included\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"298\" src=\"https://s.cystack.net/resource/home/content/19053112/image-1024x298.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-15495\" srcset=\"https://s.cystack.net/resource/home/content/19053112/image-300x87.png 300w, https://s.cystack.net/resource/home/content/19053112/image-1024x298.png 1024w, https://s.cystack.net/resource/home/content/19053112/image-768x223.png 768w, https://s.cystack.net/resource/home/content/19053112/image-1536x447.png 1536w, https://s.cystack.net/resource/home/content/19053112/image-2048x596.png 2048w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eRequest captured\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"949\" height=\"401\" src=\"https://s.cystack.net/resource/home/content/19053232/image.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-15496\" srcset=\"https://s.cystack.net/resource/home/content/19053232/image-300x127.png 300w, https://s.cystack.net/resource/home/content/19053232/image-768x325.png 768w, https://s.cystack.net/resource/home/content/19053232/image.png 949w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 949px) 100vw, 949px\" /\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003ePayload is trigged\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"\u003eRemediation\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eFlarum users should update their platform to the latest version (\u0026gt;=1.6.2) according to the below instruction\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cpre class=\"wp-block-code\"\u003e\u003ccode\u003e# Update to latest version\ncomposer update --prefer-dist --no-dev -a -W\n\n# Verify that you're on v1.6.2\ncomposer show flarum/core\n\n# Clear cache\nphp flarum cache:clear\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan class=\"span-reading-time rt-reading-time\" style=\"display: block;\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"rt-label rt-prefix\"\u003eReading Time: \u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan class=\"rt-time\"\u003e 2\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan class=\"rt-label rt-postfix\"\u003eminutes\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003eCyStack Advisory ID CSA-2022-01 CVE IDs CVE-2022-41938 Severity Critical CVSS v3 Base 9.0 Synopsis CyStack\u0026#8217;s researchers recently discovered a Stored XSS vulnerability in the Flarum platform version 1.5.0 to 1.6.1 which can lead to an account takeover attack.

Hiện nay, các nền tảng cho phép Flash Loan được biết đến phổ biến trên thị trường có AAVE, DyDx, Uniswap. Có thể hiểu đơn giản, Flash Loan là một dịch vụ cho người dùng vay nóng cryptocurrency.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eĐối với các dịch vụ vay nợ truyền thống, luôn tồn tại hai rủi ro với người cho vay. Một là người dùng sau khi vay không có khả năng hoàn trả. Hai là người cho vay thực hiện cho vay quá nhiều tài sản, dẫn đến thanh khoản thấp, không có khả năng thực hiện được các tác vụ khác.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eTuy nhiên, với Flash Loan, hoàn toàn có thể giải quyết hai vấn đề trên. Flash Loan về cơ bản hoạt động như sau: Người vay sẽ được vay một khoản tùy ý mà không cần thế chấp, nhưng đồng thời, người vay cần phải đảm bảo việc hoàn trả lại số tiền đã vay trong cùng một giao dịch. Nếu người vay không thể trả được khoản vay trong cùng giao dịch đó, toàn bộ giao dịch sẽ bị revert, coi như chưa có gì xảy ra cả. Quy trình của một Flash Loan được minh họa trong lược đồ dưới đây:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"\u003e\u003cimg decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://s.cystack.net/resource/home/content/24065021/1-VN.png\" alt=\"\" /\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eTưởng chừng như vô lý, nhưng tất cả những điều kiện này đều có thể được đáp ứng thông qua các smart contract.

target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003eFlarum \u003c/a\u003eplatform version 1.5.0 to 1.6.1 which can lead to an account takeover attack. Flarum is a widely used simple and \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/flarum/flarum\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003eopen-source \u003c/a\u003eforum platform. At the time of this post, we estimate that there are about 1200 active Flarum websites.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eExploiting this vulnerability is very simple as the attacker just needs to create a post that included the payload on the target forum and wait for forum users to access the post. The attacker can then obtain cookies from the victims and take over their accounts on the forum.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eCyStack reported this issue to the Flarum team via \u003ca href=\"https://huntr.dev/bounties/disclose/?target=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fflarum%2Fcore\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003etheir bug bounty program\u003c/a\u003e and got confirmation from the team. A patch and announcement were released quickly after that at https://discuss.flarum.org/d/31999-critical-security-update-to-flarum-core-v162\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"details\"\u003eDetails\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe \u003cstrong\u003etitle \u003c/strong\u003eis a required field when a user creates a discussion in the forum. The problem here is that developers did not sanitize this variable before rendering to the HTML, which resulted in the attacker being able to generate malicious payloads and attach them to the title field when creating the post. Once the victim opens this post, a payload will be executed that can steal user cookies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to the Flarum team\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cblockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eFlarum\u0026#8217;s page title system allowed for discussion title inputs to be converted into HTML DOM nodes when rendered (visiting a discussion page). This change was made in v1.5.0 and was not noticed.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis allowed for any user to type malicious HTML markup within discussion title user input, either through a new discussion o renaming an existing one, and have this execute on client browsers. Entering faux-malicious HTML markup, such as\u0026nbsp;\u003ccode\u003e\u0026lt;img src=x onerror=alert(document.domain)\u0026gt;\u003c/code\u003e\u0026nbsp;resulted in an alert box appearing on the forum. This attack could also be modified to perform AJAX requests on behalf of a user, possibly deleting discussions, modifying their settings or profile, or even modifying settings on the Admin panel if the attack was targeted towards a privileged user.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ccite\u003ehttps://discuss.flarum.org/d/31999-critical-security-update-to-flarum-core-v162\u003c/cite\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"\u003ePoC\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"950\" height=\"327\" src=\"https://s.cystack.net/resource/home/content/19052738/image.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-15494\" srcset=\"https://s.cystack.net/resource/home/content/19052738/image-300x103.png 300w, https://s.cystack.net/resource/home/content/19052738/image-768x264.png 768w, https://s.cystack.net/resource/home/content/19052738/image.png 950w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 950px) 100vw, 950px\" /\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eCreate a Discussion with the payload included\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"298\" src=\"https://s.cystack.net/resource/home/content/19053112/image-1024x298.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-15495\" srcset=\"https://s.cystack.net/resource/home/content/19053112/image-300x87.png 300w, https://s.cystack.net/resource/home/content/19053112/image-1024x298.png 1024w, https://s.cystack.net/resource/home/content/19053112/image-768x223.png 768w, https://s.cystack.net/resource/home/content/19053112/image-1536x447.png 1536w, https://s.cystack.net/resource/home/content/19053112/image-2048x596.png 2048w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eRequest captured\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"949\" height=\"401\" src=\"https://s.cystack.net/resource/home/content/19053232/image.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-15496\" srcset=\"https://s.cystack.net/resource/home/content/19053232/image-300x127.png 300w, https://s.cystack.net/resource/home/content/19053232/image-768x325.png 768w, https://s.cystack.net/resource/home/content/19053232/image.png 949w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 949px) 100vw, 949px\" /\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003ePayload is trigged\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"\u003eRemediation\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eFlarum users should update their platform to the latest version (\u0026gt;=1.6.2) according to the below instruction\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cpre class=\"wp-block-code\"\u003e\u003ccode\u003e# Update to latest version\ncomposer update --prefer-dist --no-dev -a -W\n\n# Verify that you're on v1.6.2\ncomposer show flarum/core\n\n# Clear cache\nphp flarum cache:clear\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan class=\"span-reading-time rt-reading-time\" style=\"display: block;\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"rt-label rt-prefix\"\u003eReading Time: \u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan class=\"rt-time\"\u003e 2\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan class=\"rt-label rt-postfix\"\u003eminutes\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003eCyStack Advisory ID CSA-2022-01 CVE IDs CVE-2022-41938 Severity Critical CVSS v3 Base 9.0 Synopsis CyStack\u0026#8217;s researchers recently discovered a Stored XSS vulnerability in the Flarum platform version 1.5.0 to 1.6.1 which can lead to an account takeover attack.

most dangerous malware that may infect computers. Operating at ring 0, the highest privilege level in the system, this super malware has unrestricted power to control the whole machine, thus can defeat all the defensive and monitoring mechanisms. Unfortunately, dynamic analysis solutions for kernel rootkits are severely lacking; indeed, most existing dynamic tools are just built for userspace code (ring 3), but not for Operating System (OS) level. This limitation forces security researchers to turn to static analysis, which however proved to be very tricky \u0026amp; time consuming. In this research, I use \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/qilingframework/qiling\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003eQiling Framework\u003c/a\u003e as the main emulator ( give him stars on Github ? ).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis research is a part of our publication at BlackHat USA 2020. The presentation is now available \u003ca href=\"https://groundx.io/docs/BHUSA2020-demigod.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst, let see how a rootkit is loaded into the kernel. The macOS kernel is officially known as XNU, which is a hybrid kernel combined from Mach kernel and BSD kernel. The kernel format also belongs to the MachO executable file. The kernel usually exposes its interface, a.k.a KPI, to let users use its functionality, and all of them are implemented inside the kernel code. Like other operating systems, macOS needs drivers to control devices, they are called Kernel Extensions or Kexts. The kernel extension is a bundle of files, and the kernel loads it from external space. Some interesting information can be gathered from \u003ccode\u003eInfo.plist\u003c/code\u003e inside the bundle. In general, rootkit plays a role as a driver then it gets full power features from KPI.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"\u003e\u003cimg decoding=\"async\" class=\"kg-image\" src=\"https://s.cystack.net/resource/home/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/1_image.png\" alt=\"\" /\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn order to emulate the driver, I decided to load both kernel and kernel extensions together. Because the kernel is also a MachO executable binary, as well as the main component of KEXT, so I can load all of their Segment64 to emulator engine. Now I can access all implemented code of KPIs from the kernel. Besides, like a normal application, I also have to resolve local symbols and some other dynamic symbols of KEXT. Note that kernel releases its KPIs through some dependencies, so It is necessary to create junk code as a kind of indirection calling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"\u003e\u003cimg decoding=\"async\" class=\"kg-image\" src=\"https://s.cystack.net/resource/home/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/img_611a0540913f2.png\" alt=\"\" /\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e \u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNext, a driver will run from its initial function, and this entry address can be extracted from the binary symbol, for IOKit driver is \u003ccode\u003e::start\u003c/code\u003e method, and for the generic driver is the address stored in \u003ccode\u003e__realmain\u003c/code\u003e symbol. Before emulating the driver, some objects/context under kernel space should be initialized. I setup \u003ccode\u003emac_policy_list\u003c/code\u003e by allocating a new object in the emulator engine and fill the address in target on kernel space. The same thing I will do for \u003ccode\u003eallproc\u003c/code\u003e symbol on kernel space. I also create some \u003ccode\u003evnode\u003c/code\u003e and \u003ccode\u003ecredential\u003c/code\u003e objects. Then I run emulation for preprocessing such as \u003ccode\u003e::attach\u003c/code\u003e, \u003ccode\u003e::probe\u003c/code\u003e, or \u003ccode\u003ekmod_info\u003c/code\u003e. Finally, I can go into the entry of the driver.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRegarding instrumentation, I map all KPIs exported from kernel to user-defined methods. It helps to simplify some features or just pass through and use the native function.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"\u003e\u003cimg decoding=\"async\" class=\"kg-image\" src=\"https://s.cystack.net/resource/home/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/img_611a0541176c4.png\" alt=\"\" /\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the other hand, I also hook thread-related KPIs to disable multi-thread functionality. I give the driver a chance to interact with the real machine with some specific KPIs. For example, \u003ccode\u003egetattrlistbulk\u003c/code\u003e is a function to retrieve every entry in a directory ( which is called inside the application \u003ccode\u003els\u003c/code\u003e ). So I just scan all files and folders in the directory and pack them using \u003ccode\u003evfs_attr_pack\u003c/code\u003e function from the kernel. To emulate syscall, I just find the \u003ccode\u003esysent\u003c/code\u003e symbol on loaded kernel space, assign arguments to registers and run the entry address.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn some cases, we may want to call a native KPI from the hooked KPI. Normally, we have to save the current state and run another emulator. But it may screw up in some complicated situations. So I have a workaround here: I create a junk code and push its address to stack as saved rip. This junk code has three main missions: prepare arguments to registers and stacks, clear stack after calling, and jump to native KPI directly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"\u003e\u003cimg decoding=\"async\" class=\"kg-image\" src=\"https://s.cystack.net/resource/home/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/img_611a054250e9f.png\" alt=\"\" /\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnder kernel, there are many events and callbacks that need to be emulated. So I build an Event Management System to listen to a register request from the driver and emulate the interaction from the user. That means I hook into KPI used to register callbacks to create a new event on EMS, then when user wants to trigger callbacks, I just emulate the corresponding address from EMS.

It was designed as an extremely lightweight publish/subscribe messaging transport. It is useful for connections with remote locations where a small code footprint is required and/or network bandwidth is at a premium. For example, it has been used in sensors communicating to a broker via satellite link, over occasional dial-up connections with healthcare providers, and in a range of home automation and small device scenarios. It is also ideal for mobile applications because of its small size, low power usage, minimized data packets, and efficient distribution of information to one or many receivers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs usual, we move from outside to inside of library and the first feature we meet is about handling a new connection:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"\u003e\u003cimg decoding=\"async\" class=\"kg-image\" src=\"https://s.cystack.net/resource/home/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2019-12-06-at-10.29.55.png\" alt=\"\"\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen client sends a message, broker server treats it as \u003ccode\u003eMG_EV_RECV\u003c/code\u003e and starts parsing the packet.

Tính từ đầu năm 2022 đến nay, đã có nhiều cuộc tấn công dựa trên hình thức này, điển hình như các cuộc tấn công nhắm đến OneRing Finance, DEUS Finance, Elephant Money, Beanstalk Farms, v.v. Trong bài viết này, chúng ta sẽ tìm hiểu xem, Flash Loan Attack là gì cũng như các cách để phòng tránh Flash Loan Attack đối với các ứng dụng Defi.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"\u003eFlash Loan là gì?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eFlash Loan lần đầu được giới thiệu bởi \u003ca href=\"https://medium.com/marbleorg/introducing-marble-a-smart-contract-bank-c9c438a12890\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eMarble Protocol\u003c/a\u003e vào năm 2018 với tên gọi Flash Lending. Hiện nay, các nền tảng cho phép Flash Loan được biết đến phổ biến trên thị trường có AAVE, DyDx, Uniswap. Có thể hiểu đơn giản, Flash Loan là một dịch vụ cho người dùng vay nóng cryptocurrency.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eĐối với các dịch vụ vay nợ truyền thống, luôn tồn tại hai rủi ro với người cho vay. Một là người dùng sau khi vay không có khả năng hoàn trả. Hai là người cho vay thực hiện cho vay quá nhiều tài sản, dẫn đến thanh khoản thấp, không có khả năng thực hiện được các tác vụ khác.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eTuy nhiên, với Flash Loan, hoàn toàn có thể giải quyết hai vấn đề trên. Flash Loan về cơ bản hoạt động như sau: Người vay sẽ được vay một khoản tùy ý mà không cần thế chấp, nhưng đồng thời, người vay cần phải đảm bảo việc hoàn trả lại số tiền đã vay trong cùng một giao dịch. Nếu người vay không thể trả được khoản vay trong cùng giao dịch đó, toàn bộ giao dịch sẽ bị revert, coi như chưa có gì xảy ra cả.

ONUS đã tiến hành vá lỗi ngay khi nhận được cảnh báo từ Cyclos, nhưng đã quá muộn.

Attackers took advantage of the vulnerability in the Cyclos software to attack even before the vendor could inform and provide patch instructions for its clients. ONUS patched the vulnerability as soon as Cyclos warned, but it was too late. As a result, 2 million ONUS users’ information including EKYC data, personal information, and password hash was leaked.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"\u003eTimeline\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e09/12/2021\u003c/strong\u003e, the Log4Shell vulnerability was published. Being aware of the seriousness of this vulnerability, we immediately informed our partners and clients of the risks associated. At that time, ONUS was carefully monitoring their system security but they did not know that Cyclos was among the software affected by the Log4Shell vulnerability.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e11-13/12/2021,\u003c/strong\u003e the attackers exploited the Log4Shell vulnerability on a Cyclos server of ONUS and left backdoors behind.

When ONUS confirmed that the user data in the AWS S3 had been deleted, we immediately planned and executed incident responses. Because the target was AWS S3, we tracked all access keys related to compromised buckets and found that several services were affected including those of Cyclos. The keys were deactivated shortly after.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e24/12/2021\u003c/strong\u003e, the attackers sent a ransom request of $5M USD to ONUS via Telegram.

That's why every business must embrace cybersecurity solutions now to safeguard assets, reputation, and trust. It's not an option; it's an absolute necessity."},"block2":{"title":"Protecting Valuable Data","content":"Imagine the nightmare of a healthcare provider experiencing a data breach. Not only can sensitive patient records be stolen, but the personal health information of individuals can be exposed. This not only erodes patient trust but can lead to legal penalties under laws like HIPAA in the United States, where fines can reach millions of dollars.\n\nMoreover, in the financial sector, inadequate cybersecurity can result in unauthorises access to customer accounts. JPMorgan Chase, for instance, faced a massive breach in 2014 affecting 76 million households. The cost? An estimated $1 billion, highlighting how a lack of cybersecurity can have staggering financial consequences."},"block3":{"title":"Risk of Asset Loss","content":"Consider a scenario where a critical manufacturing company falls victim to ransomware. Production lines grind to a halt, affecting not just the company's finances but also disrupting supply chains, leading to delayed shipments and lost contracts. The notorious WannaCry ransomware attack paralyzed parts of the National Health Service (NHS) in the UK, costing them an estimated £92 million.\n\nIntellectual property theft hits technology firms hard. Think of a startup that's spent years developing groundbreaking software. Without robust cybersecurity, they risk a competitor hacking their system, stealing their code, and bringing a similar product to market before they can. This can spell the end of their business dreams."},"block4":{"title":"Impact on Business Performance","content":"Operational disruption due to a cyberattack can be painfully tangible. When shipping giant Maersk fell victim to NotPetya ransomware, it resulted in weeks of operational chaos, with ships unable to dock, ports congested, and cargo delayed. The estimated cost? A staggering $300 million in direct damages.\n\nCustomer loyalty is a precious asset. In 2013, Target, a major US retailer, suffered a data breach that affected 40 million credit card numbers. Sales plummeted, and their reputation took a severe hit. The breach not only led to financial losses but also dented customer trust, taking years to rebuild."},"block5":{"title":"Compliance and Legal Obligations","content":"Failure to comply with GDPR isn't just about regulatory fines. It's about avoiding the potential for massive penalties. British Airways faced a record £183 million ($230 million) fine for a data breach, while Google was fined €50 million ($57 million) for GDPR violations. These fines aren't hypothetical; they are real hits to a company's finances.\n\nIn healthcare, a breach of HIPAA can lead to severe legal consequences. For instance, a healthcare provider in the US, Cottage Health, paid a $3 million settlement after a data breach exposed patient records.\n\nFurthermore, customer trust is priceless. Companies like Apple have made privacy and security a core selling point.
