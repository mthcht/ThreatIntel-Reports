A commissioned study conducted by Forrester Consulting on behalf of Google Cloud reveals a critical challenge: the overwhelming volume of threat feeds and a persistent shortage of skilled analysts has left most organizations in a vulnerable, reactive state. In fact, the research found that a staggering 72% of organizations report they are mostly reactive when it comes to cybersecurity threats. This reactive posture leaves them constantly a step behind attackers, trying to mitigate damage rather than preventing it.\n\nJoin Jitin Shabadu, a leading threat intelligence analyst from Forrester, and Jayce Nichols from the Google Threat Intelligence Group, for an in-depth discussion on the key findings from this new global study and how security teams can change the narrative to be more proactive and explore how the adoption of AI is set to transform the industry, helping security teams respond faster and focus on what matters most.\n\nAttend this webinar to discover the answers to critical questions that are top-of-mind for security leaders today, including:\n*Do they feel their organization must leverage AI to improve its ability to operationalize threat intelligence?\n*How concerned are security and IT leaders about evaluating ROI and determining KPIs for the intelligence overload?\n*Who says their organization needs to improve its understanding of the current cyberthreat landscape?\n\nDon't miss this opportunity to gain valuable insights into the global state of threat intelligence and start your journey from a reactive to a proactive security posture.","link":"https://www.brighttalk.com/webcast/7451/649675","status":"upcoming","duration":3600},{"date":"2025-08-14T15:00:00.000Z","id":648354,"channelId":7451,"thumbnail":{"alt":"From Helpdesk to Hypervisor: Defending Your VMware vSphere Estate from UNC3944","url":"https://cdn.brighttalk.com/ams/california/images/communication/648354/image_1050932.png?width=640\u0026height=360"},"title":"From Helpdesk to Hypervisor: Defending Your VMware vSphere Estate from UNC3944","description":"A sophisticated threat actor, UNC3944 (also tracked as Scattered Spider and 0ktapus), is executing highly effective attacks against corporate networks, culminating in ransomware deployment directly from the VMware hypervisor. Their campaign bypasses traditional security tools by avoiding malware in the initial stages and exploiting a critical visibility gap: the inability of Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) to monitor the vSphere control plane.\n\nThe attack begins with clever social engineering of an IT helpdesk to gain an initial foothold in Active Directory. From there, the actor \"lives off the land,\" using legitimate administrative tools to pivot from AD to the vCenter Server. By gaining control of the virtual infrastructure, they can perform offline data exfiltration, sabotage backups, and encrypt entire datastores from the ESXi hosts, rendering in-guest security agents powerless.\n\nThis webinar provides a deep dive into the five distinct phases of UNC3944's proven playbook. We will dissect their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) and present a fortified, three-pillar defense strategy focused on proactive hardening, architectural integrity, and advanced detection. Join us to learn how to protect your most critical infrastructure from this immediate and growing threat.","link":"https://www.brighttalk.com/webcast/7451/648354","status":"upcoming","duration":3600},{"date":"2025-07-23T15:00:00.000Z","id":646288,"channelId":7451,"thumbnail":{"alt":"Threat Hunting con Google Threat Intelligence, Episodio 4 (Versión en Español)","url":"https://cdn.brighttalk.com/ams/california/images/communication/646288/image_1046139.png?width=640\u0026height=360"},"title":"Threat Hunting con Google Threat Intelligence, Episodio 4 (Versión en Español)","description":"Únase a uno de nuestros mejores investigadores de Google Threat Intelligence para una sesión en vivo paso a paso sobre threat hunting con Google Threat Intelligence.

Get insight on the actor and expert advice on hardening your enterprise.\n\nFrom late 2024 through early 2025, Google Threat Intelligence Group observed a decline in activity conducted by certain threat clusters, such as UNC3944 and UNC3786, associated with the underground community known as \"The Com.\" Some of these threat clusters, including UNC3944, overlap with public reporting on Scattered Spider, which may be behind recent ransomware attacks impacting the UK retail sector. We recently observed activity using similar TTPs impacting US organizations operating in multiple sectors including retail. Preliminary analysis indicates that there are TTP overlaps with prior activity originating from threat clusters associated with The Com, but attribution to specific threat clusters is still ongoing at this time.\n\nThreat actors associated with The Com have historically been aggressive, creative, and particularly effective at circumventing mature security programs. They have had a lot of success with social engineering and leveraging third parties to gain entry to their targets. Mandiant has provided a hardening guide based on our experience with more details on their tactics and steps organizations can take to defend themselves.\n\nThis webinar will provide critical insights and actionable recommendations to defend against the evolving tactics of UNC3944 and related groups.
